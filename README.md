## Featured Project: Basketball Shot Analysis with Computer Vision

[**Basketball Shot Analysis Repository**](https://github.com/KajariBhaumik/Basketball_Shot_Analysis)

This project leverages computer vision to automate basketball shot analysis, focusing on detecting key frames like the release frame and identifying critical objects. The goal is to provide actionable insights to enhance player performance and coaching strategies.

### Highlights:
- **Object Detection:** Fine-tuned YOLOv8 to detect basketball, shooter, and hands with high precision and recall.
- **Release Frame Detection:** Automated identification of the frame where the ball is released using a custom-trained YOLO class.
- **Spin Axis Calculation:** Used blob detection and motion tracking to analyze basketball rotation kinetics.

- [H & M Product Recommendation](https://github.com/KajariBhaumik/HnM_Product_Recommendation): H&M group is a well known family of brands and businesses that has over 4,800 retail stores and caters to 53 online markets. It organized a kaggle competition and invited participants to develop product recommendations based on data leveraging over 31 million transaction data involving over 1.3 million unique customers and more than 100,000 products. 

  As part of the solution, a market basket analysis was conducted using [RFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFM_(market_research)) scores. Next,   this analysis helped identify homogenous groups of customers using K-means clustering. Finally, product recommendations were generated by       implementing cosine similarity and collaborative filtering algorithms.



- [Airbnb Asheville Market](https://github.com/KajariBhaumik/AirBnb_Market_Analysis): Airbnb operates an online marketplace for lodging, vacation rentals and tourism activities. Since its launch in 2007-08, Airbnb has seen exponential growth. Currently Airbnb is valued at over $100Bn with about 6 million listings worlwide. 

  In this project, an effort was made to understand the organic growth of Airbnb in Asheville, NC. ARIMA time-series model was developed to       forecast the demand of listings using over 70,000 historical booking information. Next, various machine learning algorithms were built and       compared for predicting the price of a listing and achieved 89% accuracy on validation dataset. Moreover, text mining and sentiment analysis     were also conducted to using customer reviews data.
